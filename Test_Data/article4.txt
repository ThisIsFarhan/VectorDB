In an architectural marvel, Japan has officially unveiled Oceanus, a futuristic underwater city designed to accommodate 5,000 residents. Located 300 feet below sea level, the city features transparent walls that offer residents panoramic views of marine life. Oceanus includes residential quarters, research labs, shopping districts, and even underwater parks. Project lead Akira Tanaka believes the city represents a solution to the problem of land scarcity in Japan, while also serving as a hub for marine research and conservation.
