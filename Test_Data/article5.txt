Archaeologists in Egypt have deciphered an ancient scroll believed to be over 3,000 years old, using artificial intelligence to reconstruct missing pieces of text. The scroll, found in a tomb near Luxor, contains writings that describe unknown historical events and royal traditions of the New Kingdom era. Using an AI model trained on ancient languages, researchers were able to fill in missing parts of the text with impressive accuracy. The discovery provides new insights into Egyptian history and shows how AI can revolutionize archaeological research.
