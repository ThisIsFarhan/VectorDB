A team of students and professors from Brookside Universityâ€™s Robotics Institute has created a humanoid robot that can communicate through complex sign language. Named "Echo," the robot is designed to help bridge communication gaps for the deaf and hard of hearing. Echo uses advanced AI to recognize and respond to spoken language, translating it into sign language with unprecedented accuracy. The university plans to make Echo open-source, hoping developers worldwide will help improve its functionality and accessibility for all users.
