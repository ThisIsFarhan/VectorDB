In a groundbreaking discovery, botanists exploring the depths of the Amazon rainforest have identified a previously unknown species of flower.
Dubbed Luna Floria, the plant displays luminescent petals that glow softly at night.
The discovery team, led by Dr. Isabella Fernandez, believes the unique glow might be an adaptation to attract nocturnal pollinators.
Local tribes in the region have reportedly known of the flowerâ€™s existence for generations, believing it to have mystical healing properties.
Scientists are now studying Luna Floria for potential medicinal compounds.
